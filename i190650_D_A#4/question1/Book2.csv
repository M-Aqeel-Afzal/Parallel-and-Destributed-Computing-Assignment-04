Our chatbot can handle different spelling variations of Roman Urdu words,detect offensive language,handle out-of-scope questions,asks follow-up questions and remembers the context of the conversation. We used the RASA framework for the development of our chatbot and we got an average accuracy of around 94% and an average F1 score of around 84% for all the user intents.It handles questions/queries falling in more than 50 different categories",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nJHHEqBxsszDneA58GmamWLcuCRRPi75/view?usp=sharing,@,"Python,RASA,PyCharm,GitHub,React,Colab,Machine Learning,NLP"

58,Augmented reality in Kindergarten,"We developed an android application that uses augmented reality (AR) to help children in pre-school improve their understanding of the environment around them. We aim to achieve this goal using computer vision and machine learning. 3D models will be displayed by implementing scene and object detection. Children can acquire information about their surroundings by using their smartphone’s camera.The application is makes use of our trained models to perform object detection and generate 3D models of the concepts being taught in their books. Moreover,the application make use of high contrast colors,animated text,and speech commands so it is easy and intuitive for the children to identify the application’s features. Scene detection will make use of neural networks,relevant machine learning algorithms,and classifiers.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jiyW-s-dBJeOWyur1Hd8xc8Ay7N30UrD/view?usp=sharing,@,"Android Studio,AR Core,Firebase,VGG 19 Deep Learning Model"
59,TryItOut,"TryItOut is a platform where users can virtually edit and try out garments. The project has multiple features such as TextureMod,where people can provide the input image of the garment and they can map the texture of their own choice on that garment. In TailorMod,the user can map the neckline of one garment on the other. In GarmentTransfer,the user will provide a picture of themselves and of the garment they want to try,and the garment will be realistically re-rendered on the user’s body. In MotionTransfer,the user can try out the garment by providing their video as well.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/17rcutat7IcAEV0fBsFC8nhn67MKyz9UN/view?usp=sharing,@,"Computer Vision,Image Processing,Machine Learning,Flask"
60,DigiLab,"DigiLab is an Augmented Reality based application that enables students of Secondary Level to do their lab experiments of Physics using just their Android phones. Using AR,we aim to digitalize the labs so that the information can be overlaid over the objects anywhere in real-time to give direct understanding of physics concepts. DigiLab will aim to revolutionize Labs/Practical in the Education Sector. There will be selected experiments according to the latest curriculum of Secondary Level’s Physics Practical. It would supplement current pedagogical materials by simply adding more contextual experiences.",https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p6AOjORED3vFe_dpUIQlq4lpKzYn85tt/view?usp=sharing,@,"Blender,Unity 3D,AR Core,C#,TensorFlow"
